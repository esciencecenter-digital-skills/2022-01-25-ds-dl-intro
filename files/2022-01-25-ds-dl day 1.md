## üîß Exercises

## 1. Introduction

#### Deep learning problems exercise
Which of the following would you apply Deep Learning to?

1. Recognising whether or not a picture contains a bird.
2. Calculating the median and interquartile range of a dataset.
3. Identifying MRI images of a rare disease when only one or two example images available for training.
4. Identifying people in pictures after being trained only on cats and dogs.
5. Translating English into French.


#### Deep learning workflow exercise
Think about a problem you‚Äôd like to use Deep Learning to solve. As a group, pick 1 problem.

1. What do you want a Deep Learning system to be able to tell you?
2. What data inputs and outputs will you have?
3. Do you think you‚Äôll need to train the network or will a pre-trained network be suitable?
4. What data do you have to train with? What preparation will your data need? Consider both the data you are going to predict/classify from and the data you‚Äôll use to train the network.

Discuss your answers in your breakout group. Write them (concisely) down in the collaborative document.

#### Exercise: Inspect the penguins dataset (breakout)
Inspect the penguins dataset.

1. What are the different features called in the dataframe?
2. Are the target classes of the dataset stored as numbers or strings?
3. How many samples does this dataset have?

##### Answers
Breakout room | Answer
--------------|-------|
1 | species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm,  	body_mass_g, sex. Target classes: String. Number of samples: 344.
2 | 1) islands, bill_length, flipper_length, body mass, sex; 2) strings; 3) 344
3 | species', 'island', 'bill_length_mm', 'bill_depth_mm', 'flipper_length_mm', 'body_mass_g', 'sex'; ; Numbers of samples is 344
4 | 1) 'island', 'bill_length_mm', 'bill_depth_mm','flipper_length_mm', 'body_mass_g', 'sex' 2) 'species' as string  3) 344
5 |1) 'species', 'island', 'bill_length_mm', 'bill_depth_mm', 'flipper_length_mm', 'body_mass_g', 'sex' 2) species: object, island: object, bill_length_mm:float64,bill_depth_mm: float64, flipper_length_mm :float64, body_mass_g : float64, sex: object, Output as strings 3) 344     
6 |1) species 	island 	bill_length_mm 	bill_depth_mm 	flipper_length_mm 	body_mass_g 	sex2) species: str, island: str, bill_length_mm: numpy.float64,  sex: str 3) 344 samples |


To see the different column headings of the dataframe, type:
```python=
penguins.columns
```

Type:
```python=
type(penguins.species[0])
```
to see the type of the species field (the target class).

```python=
penguins.describe()
```
is also useful for getting various stats about the dataset.

#### Exercise: Pairplot
Take a look at the pairplot we created. Consider the following questions:

1. Is there any class that is easily distinguishable from the others?
2. Which combination of attributes shows the best separation for all 3 class labels at once?




## üß† Collaborative Notes


### Intro (for reference - no need to type along for this section)

First a unit/node/neuron:
```python=
import numpy as np

inputs = np.array([0, 0.5, 1])
weights = np.array([1, -0.5, 0.5])
bias = 1

print('Inputs * weights:', inputs * weights)
print('Weighted sum without bias', sum(inputs * weights))
weighted_sum = sum(inputs * weights) + bias
print('Weighted sum with bias', weighted_sum)
```

And its activation function:
```python=
def relu(x):
    return max(0, x)
```

```python=
activation = relu(weighted_sum)
print(activation)
```

### Troubleshooting installation
Try:
```bash
pip install tensorflow seaborn scikit-learn pandas
```
Or
```bash
conda update --all
conda install tensorflow seaborn scikit-learn pandas 
```
without version requirements. If you have already installed `conda`, these commands are independent of your operating system.


### Classification by a Neural Network using Keras

#### Open a Jupyter notebook
Please open a Jupyter notebook so you can follow along :)

On the command line (e.g. a terminal) you can usually do this by typing:
```bash=
jupyter-lab
```

This should open in your web browser. Select a new python notebook.

#### Formulate/Outline the problem
We will use a standard penguin dataset available in seaborn. We're going to train a neural network to distinguish between the three types of penguins.

[](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/deep-learning-intro/fig/palmer_penguins.png)


```python=
import seaborn as sns

penguins = sns.load_dataset('penguins')
```

```python=
type(penguins)
```
Shows us that it is a pandas dataframe.

Look at the first couple of rows:
```python=
penguins.head()
```

#### Visualising our dataset
```python=
sns.pairplot(penguins, hue='species')
```

#### Preparing data
Check data type of target class
```python=
penguins['species'].dtype
```
It is type Object.

There are in fact only three possible values for the species. So let's turn the datatype into a categorical type.

```python=
# Change types if needed
penguins['species'] = penguins['species'].astype('category')

penguins['species']
```

You will see that now pandas has automatically determined that there are three categories the species can have.

```python=
# Select features
penguins_filtered = penguins.drop(columns=['island', 'sex'])

# Filter missing rows
penguins_filtered = penguins_filtered.dropna()
```

```python=
penguins_features = penguins_filtered.drop(columns=['species'])
```


```python=
import pandas as pd

target = pd.get_dummies(penguins_filtered['species'])
target
```

This has created a [one-hot encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot) for the species target.


#### Splitting into a training and a test set
```python=
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(penguins_features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=0, shuffle=True, stratify=target)
```

Check the contents of the two sets:
```python=
y_train.sum()
```

```python=
y_test.sum()
```

#### Keras for Neural Networks
```python=
from tensorflow import keras
```

```python=
from numpy.random import seed

seed(1)

from tensorflow.random import set_seed
set_seed(2)
```

#### Start building architecture from scratch

```python=
inputs = keras.Input(shape=X_train.shape[1])
```

```python=
hidden_layer = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu')(inputs)
```

```python=
output_layer = keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')(hidden_layer)
```

```python=
model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=output_layer)

model.summary()
```


## üí≠ Feedback
Think about todays lesson, please write (at least) one thing
that went well and (at least) one thing that can be improved.

Think about content (anything you liked or missed), logistics, pace of instructions, instructors/helpers, setup instructions etc.

### What went well:
* Very thoughtful to make sure every one was able to install the packages needed to actively follow the course
* Nice to actively code
* Discussion in breakout-room
* Opportunity to have time to solve problems in breakout-rooms
* I liked the active discussions of the exercises, for example inviting someone to comment on the answers. I liked the flow of the exercises and theory, it was smooth
* practical excersises, good job!
* Setup instructions were clear. I liked the notebook session. By typing the commands yourself you get a better understanding of the process.
* practical part was really good
* I liked the practical part

### What could be improved:
* Not nessecarily an improvement; but the intro was very accessible. When starting to program the model, it was more following what Djura did, decreasing the amount of thinking to be done by the participant (I personally did not understand all steps fully)
* Explain more in detail, what the code means (I can typ it over, but do not always understand what I am doing)
* more theory with some pictures, may help for better understanding, for example about softmax , relu etc
* theoretical concepts could be explained more elaborately. Maybe a few foundational texts in preparation of the course would be great (e.g. from Norvig and Sandvig's newest introduction to AI)
* Maybe before the exploration of the pandas dataframe it could be useful to have some terminology defined, e.g. target classes, etc.
